# It is possible to set these are defaults with messy jinja templating one liners however:
# 1. That is really hard to read and debug
# 2. When running multiple plays with the same role the defaults are not re-evaluated. An example of this
# can be seen in our the https://github.com/elastic/ansible-elasticsearch/blob/master/test/integration/xpack.yml
# integration test and in the Multi Node server documentation examples https://github.com/elastic/ansible-elasticsearch/blob/master/test/integration/xpack.yml
